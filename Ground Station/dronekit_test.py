# Steps
# (see https://dronekit-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/mission_basic.html)
# 1 - Connect to vehicle using telemetry radio (before flight)

# 2 - Do any setting up required on the vehicle
#     ex: set home location, zero altitude calibration, etc

# 3 - PRIMARY AIRCRAFT TAKEOFF

# 4 - Setup mission (Once target is acquired)

#      >> Missions (AUTO Mode): https://dronekit-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/auto_mode.html

#  -> Set command: Post-release loiter? Or set a condition to start the motor at a certain altitude below the PA after launch
#     ex:
#     >> MAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_TO_ALT:
#     - Loiter while climbing/descending to an altitude.

#     >> MAV_CMD_NAV_ALTITUDE_WAIT:
#     - Mission command to wait for an altitude or downwards vertical speed.

#  -> Set command: Target location waypoint, land on target
#       - Auto Landing: https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/automatic-landing.html#automatic-landing
#       - Other commands: https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/common-mavlink-mission-command-messages-mav_cmd.html

#  -> Upload commands

# 5 - Set vehicle to 'Auto' mode (this effectively begins the Mission)
# 6 - After landing, disarm and quit
